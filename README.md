# Android-nRF-UART

nRF UART app can be used to connect to BluetoothÂ® Smart devices running a custom Nordic Semiconductor UART service. When connected, the app can send and receive ASCII and UTF-8 text strings. 

This app works with the ble_app_uart project in the nRF51 SDK and the Bluetooth Smart SDK for Arduino. 

This app created as a demonstration for handling 128 bit proprietary UUID service and characteristics. 

This source code can be compiled with Android Studio and Gradle.
